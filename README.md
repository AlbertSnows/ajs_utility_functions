# ajs_utility_functions
An aimless library for me to play around with random environments, libraries, and functions. I tend to rewrite the same functions over time in new contexts as I write code. This repo is a playground to explore function design ideas, good and bad. It uses example problems, such as from leetcode, to elicit such ideas. 

Library is expiremental and does not represent actual code that should be used anywhere, but if you do use it then hey that's pretty cool.
