# ajs_utility_functions
An aimless library for me to play around with random environments, libraries, and functions. I tend to rewrite the same functions over time in new contexts as I write code. This repo is a playground to explore function design ideas, good and bad. 

Library will perpetually be a WIP and should probably not be used for production use cases until I update this otherwise.
